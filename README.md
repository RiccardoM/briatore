# Briatore - Italy tax report helper
Briatore takes its name from Flavio Briatore, one of the Italy's most famous tax evader of the recent history. 

It represents a tool that can help you fill out your tax report if you live in Italy. To do so, given the details of a Cosmos-based chain, it gets the following data from the chain itself: 
- your balance as per 1st January
- your balance as per 31st December

Balances are returned both in amount of coins as well the corresponding amount of Euros they were worth at those dates.
